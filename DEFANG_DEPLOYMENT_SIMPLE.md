# Simple Deployment Guide for Defang.io

## What You Need

1. A Defang.io account: https://www.defang.io/
2. Your Google Maps API key
3. The files we've created (you have everything!)

## Installation Options

Since the Defang CLI installation had issues, here are your options:

### Option 1: Use Defang Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Go to**: https://www.defang.io/
2. **Sign up** for a free account
3. **Upload** your project files
4. **Configure** via their web dashboard

### Option 2: Manual CLI Installation

1. **Download** Defang CLI:
   ```bash
   # Visit https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang/releases
   # Download defang-darwin-arm64.tar.gz for your system
   tar -xzf defang-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
   sudo mv defang /usr/local/bin/
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/defang
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   # To Playground (free, no cloud account)
   defang compose up --playground
   
   # Or with your own cloud account
   defang compose up --platform aws  # or gcp, digitalocean
   ```

### Option 3: Use Docker Compose Directly (Alternative to Defang)

Since Defang is built on Docker Compose, you can deploy the app to any cloud that supports Docker:

**AWS (EC2):**
1. Launch EC2 instance
2. Install Docker
3. Clone your project
4. Run: `docker-compose up`

**DigitalOcean App Platform:**
1. Connect your GitHub repo
2. They auto-detect docker-compose.yml
3. Deploy automatically

**Railway or Render:**
1. Connect GitHub repo
2. Use docker-compose.yml
3. Deploy

### Option 4: PythonAnywhere (Recommended for Easy Deployment)

Since Defang CLI installation is problematic, I recommend using PythonAnywhere instead:

**It's easier and we already have all the files ready!**

1. Read: `PYTHONANYWHERE_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Go to: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
3. Upload your files
4. Deploy!

## My Recommendation

Given the CLI installation issues, I recommend:

**Option A: Use PythonAnywhere** (Easiest)
- We have complete deployment files
- No CLI installation needed
- Free tier available
- Web-based interface
- Read: `PYTHONANYWHERE_DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Option B: Use Docker Compose** (More flexible)
- Already created `docker-compose.yml`
- Works with any cloud that supports Docker
- Deploy to: AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, Railway, Render, etc.

**Option C: Manual Defang** (If you can install CLI)
- Download CLI manually from GitHub releases
- Use the files we created

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

If you want to test locally first:

```bash
# Build and run
docker-compose up --build

# Run migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

# Visit
http://localhost:8000
```

## Choose Your Deployment Method

1. **PythonAnywhere** - Easiest, read `PYTHONANYWHERE_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. **Docker Compose** - Use the `docker-compose.yml` we created
3. **Defang** - If you can install the CLI manually
