# Push to GitHub - Quick Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `tech-routing-django` (or your choice)
3. Description: "Multi-role Django technician routing application with OR-Tools and Google Maps"
4. Choose: Public or Private
5. **Don't** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click "Create repository"

GitHub will show you commands - **DON'T run them yet!** We'll use different commands.

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tech-routing-django.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Alternative - If You Get Authentication Error

If GitHub asks for authentication:

**Option A: Use Personal Access Token**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Give it repo permissions
4. Use token as password when pushing

**Option B: Use GitHub CLI**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Then push normally
git push -u origin main
```

**Option C: Use SSH (Recommended)**
```bash
# If you have SSH key set up
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/tech-routing-django.git
git push -u origin main
```

## After Pushing

Once your code is on GitHub, you can:

1. **Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform**
   - Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use the docker-compose.yml we created

2. **Or deploy elsewhere**
   - The docker-compose.yml works with any cloud
